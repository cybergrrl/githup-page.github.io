	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a self-taught coder and regular <a href="https://codebar.io/">codebar</a> student in Brighton, UK. I know Ruby and Python and have also done some Javascript. Currently, I am working through <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp">The Complete Python Bootcamp</a> on Udemy. 
</p>
<p>
	Previously, I have made my way through <a href="https://nostarch.com/rubywizardry">Ruby Wizardry</a> by Eric Weinstein.

</a> It's great, check it out!

	I wrote a little game for Ruby, it is a text-based adventure game. I wrote it before I learned about classes. It works, but I would probably approach it completely different now. It can be found in my github repositories as "labyrinth game".
